		<h1>Bonn Experiment System Tutorial</h1>

		<div id="abstract">
		This tutorial intends to show you how to use BoXS to create and conduct experiments in 9 easy steps.</div>
	
	
	  	<h2>1.) Open your web browser...</h2>
	  	...and open the address 
	  	<a href="http://boxs.uni-bonn.de/">http://boxs.uni-bonn.de/</a>. <br>
		<br>
		<img src="pic01.png">
		<div id="note">You can use any operating system and browser you like to use BoXS, as long as they support Java applets. 
		For the screenshots on this page xubuntu-Linux is used as operating system and Google Chrome is used 
		as the browser.</div>
		
		
		<h2>2.) Click on the "Start Experiment!"-button</h2>
		<img src="pic02.png">
		<br>
		
		<h2>3.) Click on "1 Experimenter, 2 Subjects"</h2>
		<div id="note">If you open this site for the first time, you will get a warning asking whether you 
		want to execute this application. Click on proceed/grant. This message will only appear once on every 
		computer.</div>
		<div id="note">If neither the experiment software as in the picture above nor the warning appears, 
		chances are that the Java plugin in your browser is not installed correctly. <br>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are using windows, download it here for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/browse/type:7">Firefox</a> or 
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.2/overview.html">Internet Explorer</a>.
			<li>If you use linux, install the "sun-java6-plugin"-package using your package manager.
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h2>4.) Take a look at the screen.</h2>
		<img src="pic04.png">
		<div id="note">The layout you see is designed to help you develop your programs. It shows the experimenter view, 
		which is the top half, as well as two subject views, which are on the bottom half. In a real 
		experiment you would of course have each view on the full screen, but for developing this 
		layout is quite useful.</div>
			
		<h2>5.) Write your first program.</h2>
		To do this, click on the code view in the top left area and enter: <br>
<pre>
display("Hello World")
wait()
</pre>

		<h2>6.) Start your experiment.</h2>
		To start your experiment click on the "Start experiment"-button (<img align="top" src="start.png">)<br>
		<img src="pic07.png">
		<div id="note">You can see that the subjects' screens now show the desired message as well as 
		a "Continue"-button. When you click on both "Continue"-buttons the experiment will end as 
		no further experiment was specified. So, you've finished your first experiment using BoXS, 
		congratulations! :)</div>
		
		<h2>7.) Write your second program.</h2>
		The second program is slightly more advanced as it uses variables and user input. 
		Click on the code view in the top left area, delete the previous program and enter: <br>
<pre>
display("Welcome to our experiment!")
display("Please enter your name:")
inputString(name)
wait()
display("Hello "+name)
wait()
</pre>		
		<div id="note">Note: In a real experiment you would probably not ask your subjects about 
their name. This example is just for illustration.</div>
			<div id="note">Click on the "Start experiment"-button (<img align="top" src="start.png">) when you are done.</div>	
<img src="pic08.png"><br>
		<div id="note">Enter some names and click on "Continue".</div>		
<img src="pic09.png"><br>
		<div id="note">As you can see the name which is entered in the first part of the experiment is successfully displayed 
in the second part.</div>		

 
 		<h2>8.) Using experiment-generated data</h2>
 		<div id="note">To examine experiment-generated data have a look at the variable monitor. The 
 		variable monitor displays both the variables you define as well as automatically generated 
 		variables (which are displayed in grey).</div>
		<img src="pic10.png">
		<div id="note">The first row displays the usernames, which are "S1" and "S2" in this case. 
		In an actual laboratory experiment you would pick something more specific like "Room11" and "Room12". 
		(more on this topic can be found in the documentation).
		The fourth row contains the values of the generated "name"-variable, in this case "Bob" and "Eve".</div> 
<div id="note">If you are interested in how the subjects behaved, you might also be interested in the "_inputhistory_name"-variable. 
This automatically generated variable tells you at which time (in msecs) he/she entered which value. Using this 
variable you can find out when which key was pressed. In this case Bob and Eve were quite the procrastinators, 
requiring about 40 seconds just to enter their names. :)</div>
  
  		<h2>9.) Exporting experiment-generated data</h2>
  		<div id="note">To export your data click on the "Export data"-button (<img align="top" src="export.png">). 
  		A file dialog will appear. Choose the desired location for the file and name it "test.csv". Data is 
  		saved as CSV, which can be read by both spreadsheet applications 
  		like Excel, as well as statistics software like Stata. 
  		After saving the file, open it using a spreadsheet application. When asked about the delimiter, select "tabulator". </div>
  		<img src="pic11.png"><br>
  		
  		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
  		<div id="note">Congratulations, you successfully completed the tutorial and have therefore written two  
  		experiments. If you want to learn more about BoXS, I recommend reading the 
  		<a href="../general/index.html">general information</a> and the 
  		<a href="../examples/index.html">code examples</a>. The   		
  		<a href="../documentation/index.html">documentation</a> contains information about all available 
  		commands and their usage. 	</div>
