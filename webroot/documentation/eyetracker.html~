		BoXS supports SMI eye trackers. This interface was developed in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods. 
		In order to use it, the SMI main program must run in the background and it must have the so-called remote command interface enabled. 
		Due to the amount of data generated by the eye tracker, the information generated is not stored like other variables within the BoXS. Instead, 
		the data will be exported into a text file which can be analysed and evaluated after the experiment. BoXS allows you to synchronise the eye tracking 
		data and the BoXS data using timestamps and triggers.
		</div>

		<h3>A simple example for setting up the eye tracker and recording some data:2</h3>

			</tr>
		</table>

		<div id="note">
		Important: If the client applet fails to save the eye tracking data to a file or complains about it during the process (exception), you need to grant 
		Java applets the right to access local files. In order to do this, you need to edit the java permissions file named java.policy. The location of this file 
		differs and depends on the Java version you have installed and the operating system. <br>Under Windows you can usually find it here: <b>Program Files/Java/jre6/lib/security/java.policy</b><br>For Linux, have a look here: <b>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/security/java.policy</b><br>Once you have found the file edit it and insert this line into the Grant-block: <br> <b>permission java.io.FilePermission "&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;","write";</b><br>
		This should solve the file-saving issue.
